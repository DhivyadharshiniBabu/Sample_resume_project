<h1>Maze Generator and Solver</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Short Description about the project :</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The concept of Advanced Data structures was implemented along with Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm and backtracking for the auto generation and solving of the square maze.</li>
    <li>The input will be given by the user as rows and columns,then the maze will be generated and solved as the output.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Language used : Python</h2>
